# NEON Bricks ðŸ§±

Every single ðŸ§± we came up with at NEON SOFTWARE STUDIOS that can help us make our day-to-day dev job easier and more fun!

## Usage of the NEON Bricks / Verwendung der NEON Bricks

Implement new ðŸ§± in the directory (```bricks```). To get started, use ```mason new``` (you need to install the [mason CLI][mason_cli_link] to be able to do so). Do not forget to add your new ðŸ§± to the ```mason.yaml``` of the [NEON Core App][core_app_link] so that the reference to your new ðŸ§± will be generated the next time!
